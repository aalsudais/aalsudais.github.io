## About


I am a PhD student (since 2016) in Computer Science at the [University of Colorado Boulder](http://www.colorado.edu/cs). I work with my advisor [Dr.Eric Keller](http://eric-keller.github.io) in the [Networking and Security Research Group (NSR)](http://nsr.colorado.edu/). My research spans the areas of Software-defined Networking (SDN), Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), and distributed, cloud, and network systems in general. I interned at [AT&T Labs Research](http://about.att.com/sites/labs_research) during the summer of 2017, and have been working closely with them ever since.
